The **Blazing Toolset** is a mid-tier toolset made from a handful of blaze powder, some powdered obsidian, and the corresponding golden tool in a [[Mechanical Mixer]].

These tools have an innate affinity for the heat of the Nether, causing them to lose no durability when used there.

Similarly, they will automatically smelt whatever blocks they mine and will ignite any mob they strike.
