**Copper** is a material generated as an ore in the world around surface level. It is used to make [[Brass]] and as an ingredient for various components. Six forms of copper exist: **Blocks of Copper**, **Crushed Copper**, **Copper Ingots**, **Copper Nuggets**, **Copper Ore**, and **Copper Sheets**.

## Obtaining
### Obtaining Blocks of Copper
Blocks of copper cannot be found naturally in the world but can be created through the following methods:
| Method | Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Crafting <br> [Compacting](Mechanical-Press) | 9 Copper Ingots | 1 Block of Copper |

### Obtaining Crushed Copper
Crushed copper cannot be found naturally in the world but can be created through the following methods:
| Method | Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Crushing](Crushing-Wheels) | 1 Block of Copper | 5 Crushed Copper |
| [Crushing](Crushing-Wheels) | 1 Copper Ore | 1 Crushed Copper <br> 2 additional Crushed Copper (30% chance each) <br> 1 [[Cobblestone]] (12% chance) |
| [Milling](Millstone) | 1 Copper Ore | 1 Crushed Copper |

### Obtaining Copper Ingots
Copper ingots cannot be found naturally in the world but can be created through the following methods:
| Method | Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Crafting <br> [Compacting](Mechanical-Press) | 9 Copper Nuggets | 1 Copper Ingot |
| Smelting | 1 Crushed Copper | 1 Copper Ingot |
| Smelting | 1 Copper Ore | 1 Copper Ingot |
| Crafting <br> [Mixing](Mechanical-Mixer) | 1 Block of Copper | 9 Copper Ingots |

### Obtaining Copper Nuggets
Copper nuggets cannot be found naturally in the world but can be created through the following methods:
| Method | Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Washing](Encased-Fan) | 1 Crushed Copper | 10 Copper Nuggets <br> 5 additional Copper Nuggets (50% chance each) |
| Crafting <br> [Mixing](Mechanical-Mixer) | 1 Copper Ingot | 9 Copper Nuggets |

### Obtaining Copper Ore
Copper ore generates in veins near surface level throughout the world. It cannot be created through any method. Since copper ore is required to create any other form of copper, this means that copper is not renewable.

### Obtaining Copper Sheets
Copper sheets cannot be found naturally in the world but can be created through the following methods:
| Method | Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Pressing](Mechanical-Press) | 1 Copper Ingot | 1 Copper Sheet |

## Usage
Copper can be used in the following recipes:
| Method | Input  | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Mixing](Mechainical_Mixer)| 1 Copper Ingot <br> 1 [Zinc Bar](Zinc) <br> 1 [[Blaze Powder]] | 2 [Brass Ingots](Brass) |
| [Mixing](Mechainical_Mixer)| 1 Copper Nugget <br> 1 [Zinc Nugget](Zinc) <br> 1 [[Blaze Rod]] (Catalyst) | 2 [Brass Nuggets](Brass) <br> 1 [[Blaze Rod]] (Catalyst; 97% chance of returning) |
| [Mixing](Mechainical_Mixer)| 1 Crushed Copper <br> 1 [Crushed Zinc](Zinc) <br> 1 [[Blaze Rod]] (Catalyst) | 2 [Crushed Brass](Brass) <br> 1 [[Blaze Rod]] (Catalyst; 93% chance of returning) |
