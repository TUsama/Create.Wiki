Create adds a few crafting ingredients for use throughout the mod. 
While some of them have few uses within Create itself at the moment, they are still handy connection points for pack-makers.

### Base Materials

* **[[Andesite Alloy]]**, used for Andesite Casing and all the low-tier kinetic components.
* **[[Copper]]**, generates in the world around surface level. Used to make Brass and as an ingredient to various components. May become an entry-point to fluid handling in future versions.
* **[[Zinc]]**, generates in the world. Used with copper to make Brass.
* **[[Brass]]**, used in Brass Casing and more advanced kinetic blocks. Entry-point to the logistical components.

### Other Materials

* **Polished Rose Quartz**, made from using Sand Paper on craft-able Rose Quartz. Can be made into [Gilded Quartz Tools](Gilded-Quartz-Toolset) and Chromatic Compound.
* **Chromatic Compound**, a higher tier ingredient which can transform into Shadow Steel or Refined Radiance through special in-world processing.
* **Shadow Steel** is created when Chromatic Compound falls into the void. Right now it can be used for [Shadow Steel Tools](Shadow-Steel-Toolset) only, but will serve as an entry-point to high-tech modules in future versions.
* **Refined Radiance** is created when Chromatic Compound absorbed enough light sources around it, or has been dropped into the light of a beacon beam. It can be used for crafting a variety of [[Curiosities|Create Curiosities]].
