The Cuckoo Clock is a handy piece of furniture inside an engineers' living room. When powered with rotational force from the back, it will display the current time. At two times of the day, the cuckoo clock will ring and play a little animation:
* A tiny pig will pop out at 12pm
* A tiny creeper will show at sun-down, right when it's possible to sleep
