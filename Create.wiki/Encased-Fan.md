The Encased Fan is a mechanical component added by Create that functions as a tool for moving entities and items, as a generator, and as an essential component for bulk washing, bulk smelting, and bulk smoking.

## Pushing and pulling

When connected to [rotational force](The-Basics-of-Rotation-in-Create), an Encased Fan creates an air flow in the several blocks in front of it, which will either push or pull entities or items depending on the direction of rotation.

## Bulk item processing

When the air flow of an Encased Fan passes through [water](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Water), [lava](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lava), or [fire](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fire), the air flow downstream of the relevant block will apply processing recipes to items that pass through. An air flow containing water will apply [bulk washing recipes](Bulk-Washing-Recipes), an air flow containing lava will apply any smelting recipe that can be applied in a [Furnace](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Furnace) but not a [Smoker](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Smoker), and an air flow containing fire will apply any recipe that can be applied in a Smoker. These recipes can be applied to items either in the world or on a [[Mechanical Belt]].

**Warning:** passing incompatible items through bulk smelting, such as your tools or smoking recipes, will **incinerate** them. This can be disastrous if you're not careful, or useful for quick item disposal. Filters can help control which items get extracted to be bulk smelted.

## Power generation

When an Encased Fan is placed facedown directly over a heat source (fire, lava, [magma](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Magma), or a [Campfire](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Campfire)) and powered by [redstone](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone), it will provide 32 [SU](Stress-Units%2C-Capacity-and-Impact) of rotational force at 16 RPM. This is tied with a [[Mechanical Bearing]] attached to a single block of [wool](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wool) as the most compact power source in Create.
