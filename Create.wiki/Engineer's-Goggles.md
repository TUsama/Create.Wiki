The Engineer's Goggles are equipment allowing the player to analyze kinetic networks.

## Crafting

Requires 1 String, 1 [[Gold Plate|Create's Materials]], and 2 of any type of Glass.

## Usage

Engineer's Goggles must be worn in the Helmet armor slot.

## Detecting speed

Upon attaching any rotating component to a network while wearing the Engineer's Goggles, a particle effect will briefly appear rotating around the component, demonstrating the direction of rotation through it's motion and demonstrating the speed of rotation through it's color.

This particle effect only appears when placing a component, and cannot be used to analyze existing components.

## Reading Gauges

Looking at a [[Speedometer]] while wearing the Engineer's Goggles will display the exact speed of the system in Rotations Per Minute (RPM), as well as the color coded speed of the system.

[[Stressometers|Stressometer]] can be read the same way, but will instead display the percentage of [[stress capacity|Stress-Units%2C-Capacity-and-Impact]] being utilized by the system, the remaining base stress capacity of the system, and the remaining stress capacity of the system at the current RPM.

## Speed Color Code

Green represents slow rotation less than 30 RPM.

Blue represents moderate rotation greater than or equal to 30 RPM and less than 100 RPM.

Purple represents fast rotation greater than or equal to 100 RPM.

## Generator Stats

Looking at a kinetic component which produces rotational force will display the base stress capacity produced by that generator and the stress capacity produced by that generator at the current RPM.

## Kinetic Stats

Looking at a kinetic component which consumes rotational force will display the base stress impact of that component and the stress impact of that component at the current RPM.
