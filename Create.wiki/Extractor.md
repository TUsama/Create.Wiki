The **Extractor** is an advanced mechanical component that functions alongside the [[Funnel]] and the [[Transposer]] as part of Create's system of moving items in and out of inventories. The Extractor is used for taking items from the world and placing them in the world or on [Mechanical Belts](Mechanical-Belt).

## Usage

### Passive item extraction
An extractor can be placed on any side of any block that has an inventory, such as an Adjustable Crate, or on the side or bottom of a [[Mechanical Belt]] encased with a [[Brass Casing]]. The extractor will automatically take items from the attached inventory and place them in the block space containing the extractor.

If a moving Mechanical Belt is below that block space, the items will become attached to it in the same way any other item in the world would.

### Filtered item extraction
The extractor has a filter slot in which any item can be placed, thereby setting the extractor to only remove the specified item from the attached inventory. Alternatively, a [[Filter]] or [Attribute Filter](Filter) can be placed in the slot to have more precise control over what items are and are not removed from the attached inventory by the extractor.
