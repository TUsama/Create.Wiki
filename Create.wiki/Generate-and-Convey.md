A lot of Create's machines need to be powered to operate. This power can be called rotational force or just _Rotation_. There are a couple different components that can create this rotational force in one way or another, they are called _Generators_. Just generation alone won't get you very far though, it still has to be relayed to the desired machines. There is a variety of different blocks in Create that can achieve just that. Best is play around with each component to familiarize yourself with its abilities. It is important to know the options when having to deal with complex connection tasks in a potentially less forgiving environment. [Below](#Table-of-Contents) you will find a list of some generators as well as some means to get the rotational force to where its needed with some quick explanations.

Multiple generators can be connected together in order achieve a greater Capacity score for the attached kinetic network. When attaching new generators to running components, it is important that the added generator rotates in the same direction as the component it is attached to. When connecting two kinetic blocks with incompatible direction of rotation, you'll notice that the blocks just break. However, trouble-shooting this will be quite straight-forward - all you need to do is to include a means of reversing the rotation between the generator and the rest

## Generators

### Water Wheel

One of the more basic generators is called the Water Wheel. This concept should sound familiar, especially to people that have been playing modded minecraft for a bit. To get it spinning, all you have to do is get some water flowing around it. Pay attention the direction the water is flowing though, as it will spin at only half the rate when water flows in the wrong direction.

### Encased Fan

A little more advanced are the Encased Fans. While these can act as a Consumer of rotation, they can also provide some as well! To get a encased fan generating, it needs to be facing down and have some heat source (e.g. Fire or Lava) directly below it. Then just apply a Redstone signal to the fan and it'll spin.

### Furnace Engine

The Furnace Engine is a more expensive endeavor than these other 2 generators, but this is rewarded with a lot more Stress Capacity. First of all, you will need 2 parts to get this generator running: The Furnace Engine itself, as well as a flywheel. The engine needs to be placed onto some furnace, then the flywheel can be attached. To get this multiblock running, the furnace needs to be turned on. That's all. But beware, once your furnace turns off, so will the engine and all your connected machines too!

## Conveyors

### Shaft

The most basic and cheapest way of transferring rotational force is the shaft. This will relay rotation in a straight line to all connected shafts.

Shafts also come in a encased variant, they have the same functionality, just look a bit different

### Cogwheel

While cogwheels can be used as fancy looking shafts, their main use is a little different. They will relay rotation sideways to other cogwheels while keeping the axis of rotation. Directly adjacent cogwheels will also reverse the direction of rotation.<br>
When mixing large and small cogwheel the [[speed of rotation|Changing Gears]] will also change<br>
Two large cogwheels at an 90° Angle allow for the axis of rotation to be changed.

### Belt

To place down belts you will need 2 shafts facing in the same direction. They can be placed in 3 orientations, horizontal, _vertical_ or _diagonal_ at an _45° angle_ (see below for some examples). Click on the first shaft and you will see some particle effects to where you are looking. When looking at a valid second shaft, these particles will turn green. Once you got a belt in place, it will relay rotation between the two shafts while keeping rotation and speed the same. You can also click a shaft onto any piece of a belt to insert an additional pulley that you can connect components to. Belts can also move items btw, check [[this page|Belts]] for more info on that.

### Encased Belt

Encased Belts will not transfer items, but are a bit more versatile than their normal counterpart when it comes to relaying rotation. You can connect any number of encased belts in a straight line to form a small network that will all relay the same rotation and speed. They will change their texture to visualize a proper connection if done correctly. This way you can also change the axis of rotation a little easier.

The analog belt pulley is a more advanced version of an encased belt that also allows some change in speed. Read more on that [[here|Changing Gears#analog-belt-pulley]].

### Gearbox

The gearbox is a simple block that relays rotation between 4 of its faces while reversing straight connections.

[\[^\]](#Table-of-Contents)

### Gearshift

The gearshift is a simple block that acts like a shaft while unpowered, but will reverse direction of rotation when a Redstone signal is applied

[\[^\]](#Table-of-Contents)

### Clutch

The clutch is a simple block that acts like a shaft while unpowered, but will stop conveying rotation entirely when a Redstone signal is applied
