A Mechanical Belt is a mechanical component added by Create that functions as a tool for conveying rotation and for moving items and entities, as well as for constructing [Encased Belts](Encased-Belt). A Mechanical Belt can be placed over any number of [Shafts](Shaft) arranged horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in a single line, provided that no obstructions are present. A [[Brass Casing]] can be placed over any segment of a belt, allowing several additional blocks to be connected, including [Conveyor Tunnels](Conveyor-Tunnel).

## Conveying Rotation

When [rotational force](The-Basics-of-Rotation-in-Create) is connected to any shaft of a belt, the belt conveys identical force to every shaft it is connected to. As such, if two shafts are connected to external sources of rotational force, a belt cannot be placed connecting them unless the force is in the same direction and at the same speed.

Currently, the surface of a belt must be horizontal, and as such a belt cannot be placed over shafts placed vertically; for this case Encased Belts are typically a better option.

## Item and Entity Transportation

An item in the world above a moving belt will be attached to its surface, carried to the end, and deposited back into the world. While on the belt, items will not be moved by [[Encased Fans]] or passively added to a player's inventory. However, items on a belt can still have bulk washing, smelting, and smoking recipes applied to them, and [Funnels](Funnel) placed over a belt can collect items. Items in a belt's inventory can also be detected or ejected by a [[Belt Observer]]. In addition, if a belt is reinforced with a brass casing, items can be added to its inventory by Funnels or removed by [Extractors](Extractor) or [Transposers](Transposer).

A player or mob that walks onto a belt will be carried by it. A player can leave a belt by holding the sneak key and jumping.
