Mechanical Crafters are contraptions capable of automatically crafting items.

## Crafting

Mechanical Crafters require 2 [[Electron Tubes]], 1 Crafting Table, 2 [[Brass Sheets]], 1 [[Cogwheel]], and 1 [[Brass Casing]].

## Usage

Right click on the front of a Mechanical Crafter to place a held item into it. Right click the front of a Mechanical Crafter with an empty hand to take an item out of the Mechanical Crafter. Right click the front of the Mechanical Crafter with a [[Wrench]] to change the direction it sends items during crafting.

Mechanical Crafters can also be automatically filled with vanilla Hoppers, [[Transposers]], or [[Funnels]]

On the back and sides of Mechanical Crafters, a Wrench can be used to connect or disconnect two adjacent Crafters.

## Power

Each Mechanical Crafter has an internal gear that can only be interfaced by adjacent Mechanical Crafters or any size [[cogwheel]].

Direction of rotation does not affect functionality in any way.

## Autocrafting

When rotated, Mechanical Crafters will begin to send their items to the Crafters they face, compounding into a crafting recipe. Crafters with Slot Covers act as empty spaces in a recipe. Mechanical Crafters will always wait for the items from other Crafters facing into it.

Mechanical Crafters will display brass Slot Covers to show they are in the process of crafting.

Mechanical Crafters are able to assemble invalid crafting recipes, but will eject the items once together instead of turning them into the crafting product.

## Shaping Recipes

Mechanical Crafters only start crafting once every relevant Mechanical Crafter either has a slot cover or an item. Two sets of Mechanical Crafters can be adjacent and not affect each other as long as they are not linked to each other at any place.

The left example is invalid due to the extraneous Crafter facing the Crafter with the stick. The middle example is valid due to the extraneous Crafter having a slot cover, thus making a complete recipe. The right example is valid due to the extraneous Crafter not facing the arrow recipe Crafters, and thus not being considered by it.

## Connecting

Mechanical Crafters which are connected together will share an inventory. Inserting items into one Crafter in a group of connected Crafters will fill each Crafter in a random but consistent order. Connections between Crafters do not affect recipe validation in any way.

Mechanical Crafters which have slot covers are still able to connect to other Crafters, allowing for certain recipes to be chained in series and autocrafted in parallel.

## Output

Once a recipe is assembled in the final Crafter, the item will either be placed into the inventory of the block the Crafter faces, or will be ejected into the world if no such block exists.

If the final Crafter directs the finished product back into the recipe, the item will never leave the Crafters and must be manually removed by a player.

## Mechanical Crafting Specific Recipes

Certain recipes cannot be crafted with regular crafting tables and require the use of Mechanical Crafters. These recipes are the [[Integrated Circuit]], the [[Gilded Quartz Tools|Gilded Quartz Toolset]], the [[Furnace Engine]], the [[Crushing Wheel]], and the [[Flywheel]].
