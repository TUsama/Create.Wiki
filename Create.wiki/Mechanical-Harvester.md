The **Mechanical Harvester** is a machine that can be rolled over crops and some plants to uproot them, harvesting produce from mature crops and replanting them when possible.

Harvesters do not take rotational power directly (shafts, cogs etc), but rather roll on their own when attached to a moving structure, such as a Mechanical Bearing or Piston.

## Harvesting

Harvesters are able to uproot any plant or crop that breaks instantly when punched. Some examples include:

- All crops (wheat, beetroot, carrot, potato etc.);
- Nether Wart;
- The stems of Pumpkins and Melons;
- Grass and flowers;
- Tall plants (sugarcane, rose bushes, tall grass etc.)

However, if the plant has some mining resistance, Harvesters will not be able to break them, blocking it in place. Some examples of resistant plants:

- Bamboo;
- Cactus;
- Pumpkins and Melons;
- Tree leaves
