The Mechanical Mixer applies **shapeless crafting** to ingredients. It requires a [[Basin]] one space underneath it to work, and will automatically process the Basin's ingredients as soon as they make a valid recipe.

The mixer is powered by an internal [[cogwheel|Generate-and-Convey#cogwheel]], and will behave as one to any adjacent components, relaying and reversing rotation sideways.

In order to function, the Mixer requires a **[[minimum speed|Changing-Gears]]** to be provided by its power source. Mixers will also process ingredients faster the more speed they are given.

## Settings

When a [[Wrench]] is aimed at the Mechanical Mixer, it lets you change the **Minimum Ingredients** required to start processing. This is very useful for preventing the Mixer from processing an individual ingredient with a valid recipe before everything is placed inside the Basin.

For example: with a minimum setting of 3, the Mixer won't process Blaze Rods into Blaze Powder, allowing you to use it as a [[catalyst|Create's-Materials]] when making Crushed Brass.
