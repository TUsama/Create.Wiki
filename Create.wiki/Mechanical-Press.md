The Mechanical Press is one of the earliest and most important machines in Create. It is used to either press or compact ingredients underneath it.

Its primary use is to press [[Ingots into Plates|Create's-Materials]], used extensively in machine recipes, such as [[Casings|Casing]].

Mechanical Presses are powered by an internal [[shaft|Generate-and-Convey#Shaft]], accessed from two opposite sides. Much like shafts, Presses will relay [[rotation|The-Basics-of-Rotation-in-Create]] along their axis. It will always press/compact items at the same speed, regardless of how much power is provided to it.

## Pressing

By default, the Mechanical Press will try to stamp items underneath it. This can be set up in two ways:

- When placed one space above any block, it will process all stacks of valid items above the block when given a Redstone signal. Items with no pressing recipe are unaffected;
- When placed one space above a [[conveyor belt|Generate-and-Convey#Belt]], it will automatically press stacks of incoming items, stalling the belt until each operation is done. Items with no pressing recipe are ignored.

## Compacting

When a Mechanical Press is placed above a [[Basin]], it will begin compacting ingredients instead of pressing them. This will attempt to craft the basin's contents into a 2x2 (e.g. Glowstone Block) or 3x3 grid shape (e.g. Block of Iron)

The Press will automatically process any valid recipe it detects inside the Basin, regardless if there are leftovers inside, as long as the Basin has inventory space remaining.
