The Millstone is a more basic equivalent of the [[Crushing Wheels]], capable of applying milling recipes to any items inserted into it. A Millstone can be powered by a shaft from below or by a cogwheel from the side, it has a moderate stress impact.

* In order to insert items, you have two options:
  * You can drop items on top of it, anything that can be processed will be picked up if the input buffer is empty.
  * You can use **Hoppers, Funnels, Transposers** or other inserters to directly feed it items from any side.

* The millstone will take some time to process the inserted ingredient and show particles while its working. Once finished, the millstone will NOT drop or output the result by itself. You can do the following to redeem them:
  * [Right-Click] the millstone with an empty hand to pick up everything in the output buffer manually
  * Use **Extractors, Hoppers, Transposers** or other exporters to pull items out of the output buffer from any side.
