Create allows you to move and animate block structures of any shape or form. This feature is extremely powerful as it proves useful in the field of automation, transportation and aesthetics.

In order to get the most out of this mechanic, it is helpful to know about the components and interactions involved in creating such structures.

## Contraption Controllers

* Depending on the use case, different controllers can be used for mounting your structure. Some push, some pull, some rotate and some do it all at once.
* These blocks have specific spaces where the anchor of the structure needs to be, and some can be configured to react differently to being stopped.

**Mechanical Pistons** are kinetically powered counterparts to Minecraft's pistons. As such, they can push **a line of blocks** in front of them, and if sticky, pull the closest one back.  
However, Create's pistons do not work on their own. They require [[Piston Extension Poles]] added at the back, in order to be able to extend. When rotated, the piston will extend exactly as far as poles have been added to the back, rather than just 1 block space.
