Many items can be farmed renewably in Create but not in vanilla Minecraft. Still other items that can be farmed in Create are renewable in vanilla Minecraft but cannot be farmed, such as items obtained through trading.

Many methods of renewably obtaining resources begin with a cobblestone generator, where water and lava source blocks are placed near each other and can be used to generate infinite cobblestone. By processing this cobblestone through Create's various methods, many resources can be easily farmed.
