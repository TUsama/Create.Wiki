The **Rotation Speed Controller**, or RSC, is an advanced mechanical component crafted from an [Integrated Circuit](Crafting-Components) that functions in conjunction with a [Large Cogwheel](Cogwheel), where the output speed of the RSC can be set to any value and does not depend on the speed of the cogwheel. Since the RSC does not create or convert [Stress Units](Stress-Units,-Capacity-and-Impact), the output speed of the RSC cannot be accelerated indefinitely without the risk of overstressing.
