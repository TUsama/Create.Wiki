Using the Schematic module you can scan a section of your world and save it as a `.nbt` file.  
This way you can reproduce it or share the structure with others.  
For this workflow you will need:
* [Schematic and Quill](https://github.com/simibubi/Create/wiki/Schematic-and-Quill) x1

Craft yourself a **Schematic and Quill** and equip it in your main hand.

1. Use [**Right-Click**] to select two corner points in the world that roughly contain your structure.  
To select corner points in the air, hold down [**Ctrl**] and **Scroll** to adjust the distance of the selected position.  
[**Right-Click**] while **sneaking** to reset the selection at any point.

2. The Selection will now stick around for further adjustments.  
Point at a side and hold [**Ctrl**] while **Scrolling** to move the face in the corresponding direction.  
This way you can bring in the faces as close to the structure as possible while keeping it fully contained.

3. Once you're happy with the selection, [**Right-Click**] again to confirm and save the file.  
Schematic Files are found in your instance folder under `schematics/`
