The **Schematic Table** can be placed and used to create written [Schematics](https://github.com/simibubi/Create/wiki/Schematic) from an [Empty Schematic](https://github.com/simibubi/Create/wiki/Empty-Schematic) or [Schematic and Quill](https://github.com/simibubi/Create/wiki/Schematic-and-Quill). The input will be consumed in the process.

Refer to the workflow on [Loading Schematics](https://github.com/simibubi/Create/wiki/Loading-a-Schematic) for a detailed explanation of the process.
