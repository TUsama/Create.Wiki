**Schematics** are Items holding a reference to Structure Files on the server.  
Obtain a Schematic by uploading locally stored schematics in the [Schematic Table](https://github.com/simibubi/Create/wiki/Schematic-Table).  
They are required for printing Structures using the Schematicannon.

**Note**: Every Player can only occupy 10 uploaded structure files on the Server. Once the limit is reached the oldest files will be overwritten. Schematics holding reference to such expired structures will become useless and have to be re-uploaded.

Refer to the [Loading Workflow](https://github.com/simibubi/Create/wiki/Loading-a-Schematic) for Uploading and Positioning a **Schematic**.  
Refer to the [Printing Workflow](https://github.com/simibubi/Create/wiki/Printing-a-Schematic) for using the **Schematic** with a **Schematicannon**.
