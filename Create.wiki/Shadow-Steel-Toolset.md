The **Shadow Steel Toolset** is a high-tier toolset made from [Shadow Steel](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/Create%27s-Materials) that requires no special machinery to create.

These tools are very powerful and effective, but they will **delete** all drops from the mobs or blocks they are used on.

This voiding property makes them exceptional in situations where the drops in question aren't usually needed, such as strip mines and experience farms. An added bonus to using Shadow Steel weapons for mobs farms is that they will boost experience gains according to the level of [Looting](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Looting) present on the weapon.
