The **shaft** is a basic mechanical component in Create. A shaft can be used to connect two mechanical components such that the rotation of one rotates the other, and shafts serve as the only blocks upon which [Mechanical Belts](Mechanical-Belt) can be placed.

## Connecting components

When two mechanical components are connected by a shaft, any [rotational force](The-Basics-of-Rotation-in-Create) provided to either component will also be provided to the other component at the same speed. As such, if both components provide [stress](Stress-Units%2C-Capacity-and-Impact), this can cause the machine to become overstressed.

## Mechanical belts

A [[Mechanical Belt]] must be placed between two shafts. The shafts must be horizontal, parallel to each other, and perpendicular to the belt itself, and they must be aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Additionally, no obstruction can exist between the two endpoints with the exception of other shafts.

A [[Brass Casing]] can be placed over any segment of a mechanical belt, and this includes segments that contain shafts.

A [[Belt Observer]] will not detect entities on any belt segment that contains a shaft.
