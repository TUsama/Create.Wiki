This magical gadget mirrors the blocks you place across one or more planes and places them automatically.  
The Wand works passively while held in the **hotbar**.

* [**Right-Click**] on a block surface to create or move the mirror to that location.
* [**Right-Click**] while **Sneaking** to configure the mirror type and orientation.
* [**Right-Click**] in the air to remove the mirror again.

Once a mirror is visible at the spot you chose, block placement and removal will be multiplied by the wand, using Blocks from your inventory.

## Configuration

Scroll on the input fields to select the mirror.
* **Mirror Once** Places a second block on the opposite side of the mirror, 2 Blocks will be used total.
* **Rectangular** Applies _Mirror Once_, and the perpendicular mirror again on both new blocks, creating 4 Blocks in total.
* **Octagonal** Applies _Rectangular_, and another diagonal mirror on the result, making it 8 Blocks after placement.

Best is to try out the mirror types and see the effect for oneself.
