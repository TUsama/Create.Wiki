The **Transposer** is an advanced mechanical component that functions alongside the [[Funnel]] and the [[Extractor]] as part of Create's system of moving items in and out of inventories. The Transposer is used for taking items from one attached inventory and placing them in another.

## Usage

### Passive item transport
A transposer can be placed in the block space directly in between any two blocks that have inventories, such as [Adjustable Crates](Adjustable-Crate). Either or both of these blocks can be a [[Mechanical Belt]] encased with a [[Brass Casing]]. Any items in the input inventory will automatically be placed in the output inventory.

### Filtered item transport
The transposer has a filter slot in which any item can be placed, thereby setting the transposer to only move the specified item. Alternatively, a Filter or Attribute Filter can be placed in the slot to have more precise control over what items are and are not moved by the transposer.
