**Zinc** is a material generated as an ore in the world. It is used with [[Copper]] to make [[Brass]]. Five forms of zinc exist: **Zinc Ore**, **Crushed Zinc**, **Zinc Bars**, **Zinc Nuggets**, and **Blocks of Zinc**.

## Obtaining
### Obtaining Blocks of Zinc
Blocks of zinc cannot be found naturally in the world but can be created through the following methods:
| Method | Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Crafting <br> [Compacting](Mechanical-Press) | 9 Zinc Bars | 1 Block of Zinc |

### Obtaining Crushed Zinc
Crushed zinc cannot be found naturally in the world but can be created through the following methods:
| Method | Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Crushing](Crushing-Wheels) | 1 Block of Zinc | 5 Crushed Zinc |
| [Crushing](Crushing-Wheels) | 1 Zinc Ore | 1 Crushed Zinc <br> 2 additional Crushed Zinc (30% chance each) <br> 1 [[Cobblestone]] (12% chance) |
| [Milling](Millstone) | 1 Zinc Ore | 1 Crushed Zinc |

### Obtaining Zinc Bars
Zinc bars cannot be found naturally in the world but can be created through the following methods:
| Method | Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Crafting <br> [Compacting](Mechanical-Press) | 9 Zinc Nuggets | 1 Zinc Bar |
| Smelting | 1 Crushed Zinc | 1 Zinc Bar |
| Smelting | 1 Zinc Ore | 1 Zinc Bar |
| Crafting <br> [Mixing](Mechanical-Mixer) | 1 Block of Zinc | 9 Zinc Bars |

### Obtaining Zinc Nuggets
Zinc nuggets cannot be found naturally in the world but can be created through the following methods:
| Method | Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Washing](Encased-Fan) | 1 Crushed Zinc | 10 Zinc Nuggets <br> 5 additional Zinc Nuggets (50% chance each) |
| Crafting <br> [Mixing](Mechanical-Mixer) | 1 Zinc Bar | 9 Zinc Nuggets |

### Obtaining Zinc Ore
Zinc ore generates in underground veins throughout the world. It cannot be created through any method. Since zinc ore is required to create any other form of zinc, this means that zinc is not renewable.

## Usage
Zinc can be used in the following recipes:
| Method | Input  | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Mixing](Mechanical_Mixer) | 1 [Copper Ingot](Copper) <br> 1 Zinc Bar <br> 1 [[Blaze Powder]] | 2 [Brass Ingots](Brass) |
| [Mixing](Mechanical_Mixer) | 1 [Copper Nugget](Copper) <br> 1 Zinc Nugget <br> 1 [[Blaze Rod]] (Catalyst) | 2 [Brass Nuggets](Brass) <br> 1 [[Blaze Rod]] (Catalyst; 97% chance of returning) |
| [Mixing](Mechanical_Mixer) | 1 [Crushed Copper](Copper) <br> 1 Crushed Zinc <br> 1 [[Blaze Rod]] (Catalyst) | 2 [Crushed Brass(Brass) <br> 1 [[Blaze Rod]] (Catalyst; 93% chance of returning) |
